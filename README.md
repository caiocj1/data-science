Notes from what I have gathered so far in my studies of Data Science, mainly from my time at Ã‰cole Polytechnique.

Notes were made in Obsidian; links work and are shown as graphs in it.

All credits for most images go to Prof. Steve Oudot (https://fr.linkedin.com/in/steve-oudot-98a3503?original_referer=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.google.com%2F), as they were taken from his material for the course of INF442 - Data Science Algorithms.
