- **Importance:** search for the nearest neighbors of a data point in the data set is a fundamental problem across data science, and is useful for:
	1. Clustering ([[k-means]], mean-shift, etc.)
	2. Information retrieval in databases
	3. Information theory (vector quantization)
	4. [[Supervised learning]] ([[kNN-classifiers]])

- **Linear scan:**
